1. "midi_info": This is a data schema that will be shared across "src/midi_controller.py", "src/midi_parser.py", "src/midi_logger.py", and "src/gui.py". It will contain information about the MIDI events such as keys, knobs, velocity, etc.

2. "log_file": This is a file path to "logs/midi_logs.txt" that will be used by "src/midi_logger.py" to log MIDI events and by "src/main.py" to initialize the logger.

3. "MidiController", "MidiParser", "MidiLogger", "GUI": These are class names that will be defined in "src/midi_controller.py", "src/midi_parser.py", "src/midi_logger.py", and "src/gui.py" respectively. They will be used in "src/main.py" to instantiate these classes.

4. "parse_midi", "log_midi", "display_midi": These are function names that will be defined in "src/midi_parser.py", "src/midi_logger.py", and "src/gui.py" respectively. They will be used in "src/main.py" to handle MIDI events.

5. "requirements.txt": This file will be shared across all Python files and "setup.py" for defining the required Python packages.

6. "README.md" and "src/installation_guide.txt": These files will share the installation steps.

7. ".gitignore": This file will be used by all files to ignore certain files from being tracked by git.

8. "setup.py": This file will be used by "src/installation_guide.txt" and "README.md" to explain how to install the application.

9. "midi_event": This is a message name that will be used by "src/midi_controller.py" to send MIDI events to "src/main.py".

10. "update_display": This is an id name of a DOM element that will be used by JavaScript functions in "src/gui.py" to update the visual readout.
