Installation Guide

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

   ```
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the setup file to install the application:

   ```
   python setup.py install
   ```

5. To start the application, run the main.py file:

Note: Make sure you have a MIDI controller connected to your machine and it's recognized by the system. The application will start logging MIDI events in the "logs/midi_logs.txt" file and display the MIDI events in the GUI.
